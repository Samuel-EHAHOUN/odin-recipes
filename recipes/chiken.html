<h1> Chicken Grilling Times</h1>
<img src="../images/chicken.jpeg" alt="chicken" height="250">
<p>Chicken and other poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Keep in mind, clear juices are not always a good indicator of doneness. Depending on the age of the bird, juices might not run clear until it's overcooked. Also, as you see from the chart, boneless cuts of chicken cook faster than bone-in pieces of chicken.</p>
